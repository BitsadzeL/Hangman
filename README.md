# Hangman
This is my version of hangman game as a beginner programmer using C++.
It is not graphical, instead it is TUI game. There is a principe of dialogue: conversation between player and computer.
There is on edifference in rules: if player makes incorrect guess, insted of drawing hanging man, quantity of hearts is reduced by one.
In order to launch game, you need to copy words from words file and save it in "words.txt" file in Visual Studio Code.
Then, use source code and launch the game.
Hope you like it!
